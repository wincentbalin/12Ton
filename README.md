# !12Ton

!12Ton helps to compose and analyse music using twelve-tone technique. It is a DOS software, running in graphic mode.

# Implementation

!12Ton was implemented using Turbo Pascal 7. It needs `graph.tpu` and `egavga.obj`. You can create the latter one using

```
binobj egavga.bgi egavga.obj grvtrb
```

The software was originally a shareware and `codier.pas` was used to create the file `12ton.miz` from `_12ton.mi` and to put the license holder information therein.
